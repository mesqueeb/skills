# Agent Skills

A collection of agent skills that extend capabilities across planning, development, and tooling.

## Development

These skills help you write, refactor, and fix code.

- **close-the-loop** — Review and close GitHub tickets, PRs, or local task files by verifying implementation, tests, and documentation.
